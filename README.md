# Asteroids-II
## Asteroids game made in Unity engine

Last year I made a simple asteroids game made using C with SFML library (I'll add it to compare later)

Now lets make it more serious.

Stage 1:
  -basic functionality
  -movement
  -configuration of objects
Stage 2 (prototype):
  -menu
  -enchanced objects behavior
  -scoreboard
Stage 3 (final):
  -graphics
  -launchable desktop app
